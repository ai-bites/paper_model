	- bug fix: autoscaling removed (line 23, plotPaper.m)
2015-09-14 (Adrien Bartoli)
	- added computation of the embedding's Jacobian in the embedding function uv2M (and commented the function, with the help of Mathieu Perriollat)
	- removed functions from the GTPSW toolkit from the 'other' directory, and fix the code to grant compatibility with the independently released version of GTPSW
	  (the fix was basically to transpose the W/Wu/Wv matrices when used)
